# SpringBoot
This code follows a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-hibernate-tutorial/">Udemy course</a> by Chad Darby on Spring Boot
<br><br><br>This code includes a project made in Section 7 using:
<ul>
<li>Spring Boot</li>
<li>Thymeleaf</li>
<li>JPA</li>
<li>MySql</li>
</ul>

To run the example code of Section 7 you must do the following:
<ul>
<li>Have mysql installed</li>
<li>Create a user in your database called "springstudent" with the password "springstudent"</li>
<li>Must've ran the sql-script found in: <a href="section7-SpringMvc-thymeleaf/01-thymeleaf-demo-employees-starter-list/sql-scripts/">"section7-SpringMvc-thymeleaf/01-thymeleaf-demo-employees-starter-list/sql-scripts/"</a></li>
<li>Now simply download the release called "thymeleafdemo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" and run it with "java -jar". </li>

</ul>
